## â€¢ Multi-language Support

Enhance Acode's capabilities by adding new languages easily. Just create a file with the language code (e.g., en-us for English) in [`src/lang/`](https://github.com/deadlyjack/Acode/tree/main/src/lang) and include it in [`src/lib/lang.js`](https://github.com/deadlyjack/Acode/blob/main/src/lib/lang.js). Manage strings across languages effortlessly using utility commands:

```shell
yarn lang add
yarn lang remove
yarn lang search
yarn lang update
```

## â€¢ Building the Application

To build the APK, ensure you have Node.js, NPM, and Apache Cordova installed on your device. Use Cordova CLI to build the application.

1. Initial setup (required only once):

```shell
yarn setup
```

```shell
yarn build <platform (android)> <free|paid> <p|prod|d|dev>
```
